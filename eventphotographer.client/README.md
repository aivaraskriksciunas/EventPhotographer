# EventPhotographer - React client

This client is based on React + Vite.

Commands:
`npm run dev` - runs dev server
`npm run build` - builds for production
`npm run lint` - runs eslint with prettier

Prettier is installed in the project, so feel free to use `npx prettier . --write` to fix your code automatically.
